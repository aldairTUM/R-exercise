## Pre-Install Libraries

Hello Professor Sebastian,

Please run the following chunk of script, this will pre-install all the libraries that are necessary, and the libraries that are already in your computer will be skipped.

Thanks

Aldair Leon

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))
abs_path <- file.path(setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path)), "scripts")
source(file.path(abs_path,"install_libraries.r"), chdir = TRUE)
install_libraries()
```
